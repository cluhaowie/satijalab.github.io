        We study the <b>causes and consequences of cellular heterogeneity </b> in complex biological systems, ranging from developing embryos and differentiated organs to malignant tumors. Their behavior represents the combined output of diverse, and interacting cells, motivating the need for molecular profiling at the single cell level.
        <br><br>

        Much of our work focuses on single cell genomics, where we are actively developing new methods for both the wet and dry lab. On the experimental front, we leverage advances in molecular biology, high-throughput robotics, and microfluidics to sensitively profile large numbers of single cells. In parallel, we focus on <b><a href="/software/">developing statistical and machine learning-based approaches</a></b> to process, visualize, and interpret these unique datasets.
        <br><br>

        We have a particular interest in immune regulation and developmental processes, and work closely with partner labs both within and outside of New York City. We are actively seeking new collaborations, and are always excited to discuss ideas, projects, and pilot experiments - please do not hesitate to <u><a href="/join_contact/">get in touch</a></u>.
