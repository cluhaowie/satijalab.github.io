<h2>JOIN US</h2>
<p>
    We are <b>actively looking to expand the lab at all levels!</b> The lab is based at the New York Genome Center, a vibrant, new, and rapidly growing research institute located in lower Manhattan. All lab members will have the option of being cross-trained in both computational analysis and experimental work, and will also have full access to nearby facilities at the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology.
</p><br>

<h3>Postdocs</h3>
<p>
    We are accepting applications for Postdoctoral Fellows in our group, and encourage interested applicants to inquire informally via e-mail. Formal applications can be filed through the Careers page at the New York Genome Center website. Postdoctoral fellows will be eligible for subsidized housing near the NYU and NYGC campuses.
</p><br>

<h3>Graduate Students</h3>
<p>
    Masters, and undergraduate students at NYU who are interested in learning more should feel free to get in touch via e-mail. Graduate students from the Biology program are welcome to join the lab. Other NYU graduate students are welcome as well, but joint supervision may be required.
